---- 1. Column Names were in first row of the data

---- 2. Changed datatypes into Integer for zipcodes and home_values. The rest are TEXT types.



---- Data Exploration



---- 1. How many distinct zip codes are in this dataset?



SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(zip_code)) AS 'Distinct Zip Codes'

FROM home_value_data;



---- There are 15452 distinct Zip Codes in the Data set.



---- 2. How many zip codes are from each state?



SELECT state, Count(Distinct(zip_code)) AS 'Distinct Zip Codes'

FROM home_value_data

GROUP BY 1

ORDER BY 2 DESC;





---- 3. What range of years are represented in the data?



WITH date_year AS (

SELECT substring(date, 1, 4) AS year

FROM home_value_data

) 



SELECT MIN(year) AS 'Oldest', MAX(year) AS 'Newest'

FROM date_year;



---- Years represented in the data range from 1996 to 2018



---- 4. Using the most recent month of data available, what is the range of estimated home values across the nation?



SELECT date, ROUND(AVG(value), 3) AS 'Average House Price'

FROM home_value_data

GROUP BY date

ORDER BY date DESC

LIMIT 1;



------ Intermediate Challenge ------



---- 5. What is the percent change in average home values from 2007 to 2017 by state? 



WITH older_value AS (

SELECT state, ROUND(AVG(value)) AS old_value

FROM home_value_data

WHERE substring(date, 1, 4) = '2007'

GROUP BY state

), newer_value AS (

SELECT state, ROUND(AVG(value)) AS new_value

FROM home_value_data

WHERE substring(date, 1, 4) = '2017'

GROUP BY state

)



SELECT older_value.state, ((new_value - old_value)/old_value) AS percent_change

FROM older_value JOIN newer_value

GROUP BY older_value.state

ORDER BY percent_change DESC;



---- 5.1 How about from 1997 to 2017?



WITH older_value AS (

SELECT state, ROUND(AVG(value)) AS old_value

FROM home_value_data

WHERE substring(date, 1, 4) = '1997'

GROUP BY state

), newer_value AS (

SELECT state, ROUND(AVG(value)) AS new_value

FROM home_value_data

WHERE substring(date, 1, 4) = '2007'

GROUP BY state

)



SELECT older_value.state, ((new_value - old_value)/old_value) AS percent_change

FROM older_value JOIN newer_value

GROUP BY older_value.state

ORDER BY percent_change DESC;



---- How would you describe the trend in home values for each state from 1997 to 2017? 

---- How about from 2007 to 2017? 

---- Which states would you recommend for making real estate investments?</sql><sql name="SQL 2">WITH older_value AS (
